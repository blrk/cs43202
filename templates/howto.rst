Background
==========

Here you describe the background of the howto.
What is the desired outcome of following this howto?

Prerequisites
-------------

In this subsection of the background, you describe any prerequisites or other
assumptions. For example, you can say, you assume you already have a base
ubuntu server install, or base fedora install. Or you for prereqs, you need
xyz installed, or xyz setup somewhere else, etc.


Installation
============

This section, you typically describe how to install whatever needs installing
as part of this how to. When referring to commands or paths to files, make
them stand out, by marking them bold, or "monospace". For example, use the
`aptitude` command to install packages.

Also, make sure you indent lists of commands, so they get listed like block
quotes. For example, to install package xyz on debian, you would run:

    sudo aptitude install xyz


Subsection
----------

If the installation is complicated (i.e. you have somethings installed via
package manager, and some installed from source code), break up the different
parts in separate subsections. Like have one section where you install
everything available from the package manager, then have other sections where
you install things via source code.

Configuration
=============

Generally, there are two parts to setting stuff up. Installing the software,
then configuring it. In this section, you'll describe how to configure/setup
the software after it's been installed.


Sub-section
-----------

You may break it up into several subsections if needed, like one for each piece of software you need to configure. Whatever makes logical sense and helps the
reader understand best.


Conclusion/Summary
==================

Kind of optional. If you feel your howto needs one, add a summary section.
You may put things in this section like, things you wanted to try but didn't,
or other ideas you had to accomplish the same goal. Or maybe things that don't
work, explain that they don't here and maybe why you think it doesn't work.

Use your judgement, and if you thin the reader would expect more info, include
it.

References
==========

Probably the most important section! Make sure to note all sources you used
in your how to here! Even if you just read something but didn't actually use
anything directly from it. Remember, this section serves as much as a
bibliography as it does a reminder of what you found when researching how to do
whatever it is you are describing here.
